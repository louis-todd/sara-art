    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I graduated from Welden college with a Diploma in Integrative Humanistic
      Counselling in 2010. Integrative Psychotherapy takes into account many
      views of human fuctioning. The psychodynamic, client-centred, behviourist,
      cognitive, Festalt therapy and transactional analysis are all approaches
      considered. After graduating I worked for the Federation of Disabled
      People and at the Women's Centre as well as in private practice.
      Currently, I work for Stand Alone, a charity that supports people
      estranged from their families. As well as this I work with young people
      and the arts. I am in the second year of studying my MA in Integrative
      Arts Practice.

      I offer different ways of exploring: sand tray, drawing, music, writing,
      as well as talking. Being creative and making things can help to
      understand feelings and experiences especially when words are hard to
      find. Sometimes when a difficulty has been drawn or made and is right
      there in front of us, it is easier to talk about. This is playful work
      that takes the person and their story seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I have a couple of sessions available on
      <strong> Tuesday afternoon & evening </strong> and
      <strong>Thursday morning</strong>. Usually, our sessions start remotely,
      but if your interest is mainly around creative work we can arrange a
      face-to-face session. I also offer canine therapy which involves a
      dialogical session in the presence of my gentle therapy dog, Smilo.
